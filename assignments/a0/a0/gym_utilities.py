=== Module Description ===

This module contains code for input and output: loading a Gym from a yaml file
and generating an html output file. It also includes two helpers: in_week and
create_offering_dict.  Putting this code in a separate module allows
gym.py to focus on code for operating on gym objects.

You will not contribute any code to this module and should not modify it.
